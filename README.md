# Dayeh-Road-Trip
The code for road trip of 50 places around Dayeh University inspired by [Randal S. Olson] (http://www.randalolson.com/2015/03/08/computing-the-optimal-road-trip-across-the-u-s/) and [JeanFrancoisPuget] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/computing_the_really_optimal_tour_acrosss_the_usa_on_the_cloud_with_python?lang=en) 
Thank you so much to make it easy to adapt and apply with another problem.

There are some assumption followed in this work: 
 a. The driving distance between A to B is assumed to be same as from B to A
 b. Optimizing the distance between point to point with the default parameters for the google maps distance matrix api: mode=driving, departure_time=now
